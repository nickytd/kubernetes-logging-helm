# kubernetes-logging-helm with [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org)

This helm chart deploys a scalable containerized logging stack, enabling log observability for kubernetes applications with OpenSearch. The deployment may take various forms, from a single node setup usable for a local development up to scaled multi nodes opensearch deployments used in production environments. It is an easy way to provision a managed OpenSearch cluster with optional kafka brokers, flunet-bits and logstash(s) supplying additional initialization steps for the various components.

Uprgade Notes 2.x to 3.0.0:
Since version 3.0.0, the chart values are renamed and follow camel case recommendation.

Chart version 4.0.0 now features OpenSearch & Dashboards 2.0.0 - [Release Notes](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/release-notes/opensearch.release-notes-2.0.0.md)

Uprgade Notes 4.x to 4.2.0:
Chart version 4.2.0 delivers OpenSearch [2.2.0](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/blob/main/release-notes/opensearch-release-notes-2.2.0.md). In this release the nomenclature is changed for the [master node](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/cluster/). Now it is called "cluster-manager". As a result the chart values.yaml is adapted as well reflecting the naming convention in OpenSearch. The "master" in values.yaml is renamed to "clusterManager".
